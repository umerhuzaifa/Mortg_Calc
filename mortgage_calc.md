Here is how the calculation goes:

S = sale price
D = down payment

i_rate = fixed interest rate from the mortgage over a month
      = a typical interest rate (per year)/12

t_rate = property tax over a month
      = a typical tax rate (per year)/12

monthly payment = S * t_rate  +   (S - D) * (1+i_rate)**360
